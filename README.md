Learning about [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/)!

## PostgreSQL Server
A PostgreSQL server is needed because itâ€™s the database engine that stores, manages, and processes the actual database. Without it, there's no database to connect to or run queries on. 

You can spin up a server using any of the following.

### PostgreSQL CLI
This option requires you to download PostgreSQL and its binaries onto your local machine. 

```
psql -U postgres
```

### Docker
This option is great to keep things isolated and you won't need to download PostgreSQL or `psql` on your local machine. _It requires Docker though!_

```
docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
docker stop postgres
docker start postgres
```

#### Common Issues
* When starting the docker container, only the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environmental variable needs to be set. It will use the default `postgres` for username and database name
    * BUT! If you want to set your own username and database name:
    
      `docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e POSTGRES_DB=mycooldb -p 5432:5432 -d postgres`
* You might run into an issue where port 5432 is used by another process (e.g. a native PostgreSQL server installed on Windows). Use the commands: `netstat -aon | findstr :5432` and `tasklist /FI "PID eq <PASTE_PID_HERE>"` to find out!

## Clients
Now that you have a server running, if you want to interact with it, you'll need a client. A client lets you send SQL commands, view outputs, and manage the database. Without a client, you have no way to talk to the server directly.

You can interact with the server using any of the following.

### PostgreSQL CLI
Just like using [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) to spin up the server, it can also be used as a client to interact with the server too.
```
psql -h localhost -U postgres
```

### GUI
But sometimes I prefer a graphical visualization better! You can use the included [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) GUI tool from when you first downloaded PostgreSQL. 

Or, I like to use the [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) GUI tool since it includes interactions with other RDBMS and NoSQL databases. It's also free, open-source, and the GUI is intuitive (at least to me)!
  * Build the Postgres connection using the following URL: `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres`
