Learning about Postgres!

### GUI
I can interact with a Postgres server using the command line tool [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) but sometimes I prefer the graphical visualization better.

For that, I like to use the [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) tool. It's free, open-source, and the GUI is intuitive (at least to me)!
